# RadixSort-Assignment
(Radix Sort)
Radix sort is a sorting algorithm, which sorts the keys based on the values of digits
in keys. It takes a queue containing n keys to be sorted, where each key consists of k
number of digits, and there could be m possible values for each digit 0 through m-1. Radix sort uses an array consisting of (m) queues for sorting of these keys. For example, if each key contains k = 3 digits and each individual digit has
m=10 possible values 0 to 9, then it will use an array consisting of 10 queues 0-9
in the sorting process of considering all digits one by one as follows.

You have to implement two Radix sorts which can sort integer and string keys
with any value of n and k.
